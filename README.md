# Food-Order-Prediction

In this project, I executed a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline, utilizing industry-standard tools such as Pandas and NumPy. I also leveraged advanced data visualization techniques with Seaborn and Matplotlib to ensure data quality and gain valuable insights. Subsequently, I conducted rigorous feature selection procedures, including correlation analysis and SelectKBest, to identify the most influential variables for model development.

Moving forward, I engineered a suite of predictive models, encompassing Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. These models were rigorously evaluated and compared to ascertain their individual merits and demerits, ultimately leading to the selection of the most suitable model. The project culminated in making precise predictions for a test dataset, enabling data-driven decision-making and actionable insights.
